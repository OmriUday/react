# Agura Home Assignment 📊

## About the Application 📌

Inspired by the design and functionality of [Agora Real](https://agorareal.com/), this fully-responsive application is tailored for both desktop and mobile users. Its core feature is the dynamic rendering of the Ant Design table on distinct pages, each with unique data and designs. Additionally, users enjoy the flexibility of adjusting column widths via drag-and-drop actions. Every table maintains its unique column configuration, stored in the local storage, ensuring user preferences persist across sessions.

## Technologies & Libraries 🛠️

### 1. React ⚛️

A JavaScript library for building interactive UIs effortlessly. We've integrated several libraries to enhance React's capabilities.
- **Documentation**: [React Official Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### 2. Webpack 📦

Chosen over `create-react-app` for its efficiency and superior performance, Webpack bundles our JavaScript files. It provides more control over the build process and allows for fine-tuning the configuration.
- **Documentation**: [Webpack Official Docs](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

### 3. Docker 🐳

Docker ensures that the application runs seamlessly across different environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" issue. It encapsulates the app and its dependencies into a "container", guaranteeing consistency regardless of where it's run.
- **Documentation**: [Docker Official Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)
